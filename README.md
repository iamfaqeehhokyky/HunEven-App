# HunEven-App
A JavaScript coding exercise using loops. Where numbers are displayed from 0 to 100. Showing the even numbers in BOLD

# HOW THIS APP WORKS?
This app only helps user to get the even number separated from the odd numbers. All that a user have to do is to know the range of numbers he want to determine the even and odd numbers from.

User will have to click The App from the nav bar, input the starting digit and the ending digit. Then click on the Display HunEven button.

All the numbers within that range will be displayed leaving the even numbers in bold characters.
